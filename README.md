Hey there everyone, I've followed up a youtube tutorial to build my first mini project - An expense tracker
This expense successfully accepts user data in the form of integral or floating point values with a text message to account for the transaction
User has to use positive  or negative values to determine credit into or debit from the account
Existing balance, expenses and income are displayed
History of past transactions with expense and income indicator colors are displayed
Balance and transactions are locally stored on the device using a JSON file
